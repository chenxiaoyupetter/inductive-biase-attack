# Understanding and Improving Adversarial Transferability of Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks
Since the paper has not yet been accepted, we have only uploaded the core code for now. But you can download our results. The adversarial attack  images generated by vit_base_patch16_224, pit_b_224, cait_s24_224, visformer_small can be download  [BaiduCloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OcbM2XebuX4q5LJLQwN4Lw)  and the password is `wijr`

# Environment
Recover the environment by

`<conda env create -f environment_transformer.yml>`

# Attacked Dataset
The used datasets are sampled from ImageNet. Unzip clean_resized_images.zip to ROOT_PATH of utils.py.

# Models

ViTs models from [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)

CNNs and robustly trained CNNs from [TI](https://github.com/dongyp13/Translation-Invariant-Attacks)  

Note that at this stage, the robustly trained CNNs are based on tensorflow, so if you want to use them, you need to change the image to [3,299, 299] and change the num_classes to 1001 in the code.  I have consulted and confirmed this with the author of  [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/20169/19928)  

# Implementation

# attack and evaluate
I wrote both attack and evaluate to the sh file

`sh run_attack and run_evaluate.sh` 

In the sh file, I've added examples that you can change to suit your needsï¼š

`python our_attacks.py --attack OurAlgorithm --gpu 0 --batch_size 1 --model_name vit_base_patch16_224 --filename_prefix paper_results --boundary self.boundary` 

` python our_attacks.py --attack OurAlgorithm --gpu 0 --batch_size 1 --model_name pit_b_224 --filename_prefix paper_results --boundary self.boundary` 

` python our_attacks.py --attack OurAlgorithm --gpu 0 --batch_size 1 --model_name visformer_small --filename_prefix paper_results --boundary self.boundary` 

` python our_attacks.py --attack OurAlgorithm --gpu 0 --batch_size 1 --model_name cait_s24_224 --filename_prefix paper_results --boundary self.boundary` 

` python evaluate.py --boundary self.boundary` 

self.boundary can be used to adjust the parameters of NSSC and HLF

evaluate.py is suitable for ViTs, considering that robustly trained CNNs use TensorFlow, we have recreated eval_cnns.py for CNNs.
